Absolutely, having a **roadmap** is crucial to keep track of progress and ensure nothing is missed. Here's a clear breakdown of our **Backend Roadmap**:

---

## **Backend Roadmap**

### 1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize project with `npm init`  
   - Install dependencies:
     - **Express.js** (framework)
     - **Mongoose** (MongoDB)
     - **JWT** (Authentication)
     - **Bcrypt** (Password hashing)
     - **Dotenv** (Environment variables)
     - **Cors** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)  
   - Set up basic server (`index.js`) with Express.

---

### 2. **Database Setup**
   - **MongoDB** connection.  
   - Create models for:  
     - **User**: name, email, password (hashed), videos uploaded  
     - **Video**: title, url, elo_score, upload_date, user_id (uploaded by)  
     - **Vote**: video1_id, video2_id, winner_id, timestamp  

---

### 3. **API Routes**
   - **Authentication**:
     - `POST /auth/register` - User registration  
     - `POST /auth/login` - User login (returns JWT token)  

   - **Video Management**:
     - `POST /videos` - Add a new video (authenticated users only)  
     - `GET /videos` - Fetch all videos  
     - `GET /videos/:id` - Fetch details of a specific video  
     - `DELETE /videos/:id` - Delete a video (only uploader can delete)  

   - **Voting System**:
     - `POST /votes` - Record a vote between two videos (handles Elo score)  

   - **Ranking**:
     - `GET /rankings` - Fetch ranked videos (sorted by Elo score) with optional pagination  

   - **Dashboard**:
     - `GET /dashboard` - Fetch videos uploaded by the logged-in user  

---

### 4. **Authentication**
   - Use **JWT** for secure routes.  
   - Middleware to validate tokens and restrict access.  

---

### 5. **Elo Rating Logic**
   - Implement the Elo rating formula:
     - Update the elo_score of the two videos based on the voting outcome.  

---

### 6. **Testing (Basic)**
   - Use **Postman** or **Insomnia** to test:  
     - Authentication routes  
     - CRUD for videos  
     - Voting system  

---

### 7. **Error Handling & Validation**
   - Add proper error messages and status codes (e.g., 400, 401, 404, 500).  
   - Use **Joi** or **Express Validator** to validate user input.

---

## **What Success Looks Like**
âœ… Users can register and log in.  
âœ… Authenticated users can upload, edit, and delete videos.  
âœ… Users can vote between two videos.  
âœ… Elo scores are updated correctly and rankings can be fetched.  
âœ… Dashboard displays user-specific video data.

What do you think? If this works, we can **start with Step 1: Project Setup**. ðŸš€
